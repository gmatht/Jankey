Known Bug: K1

Sometimes keytest will freeze, and  watch_keytest.sh will display a huge "age" (time since keytest was responsive) like:

$ ./watch_keytest.sh | head
TMP_DIR tmpfs/keytest/out/t20/
NOW_SEC 1310544433 vs 1310386857 (AGE: 157576)
...

You can fix this by running:
 sudo -u keytest killall  -9 lyx
