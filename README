--- LyXtest ---

This is a program to spam LyX with millions of randomly generated key
presses, and collect the crash results.

Since the code involves spamming random keypresses, I run it under a special
user "keytest", well away from my main X windows session.

To use this software, first configure it by editing the 
configuration parameters in shared_functions.sh and shared_variables.sh
then run the following:

./setup.sh   # add keytest user and apt-get required files
sudo -H -u keytest -e xterm # Create a xterm for running keytest in
. ./initXvfb # sets up a fake X server for keytest to play in
./main.sh

Note that this bug finding software is itself quite buggy.

CONTENTS:

README: this readme file
report_html.sh: A quick way of generating bug reports and an overview from the logs.
make_screen_shots.sh: a script for making screenshots, if they are missing from output of above.
autolyx: A script to continually restart lyx and collect the bug reports
maketar.sh: Makes this tar file :)
keytest.py: Sends randomly generated keypresses to the LyX window.
killtest: stop the testing
stock_text: The stock test to add to each bug report.
watch_keytest.sh: Dumps various info on what keytest is doing, often run as "watch watch_keytest.sh"

OUTPUTS:

autolyx: Outputs out/*.GDB, a log of all output, including backtraces.
keytest.py: Outputs out/*.KEYCODES, a list of all keycodes sent to LyX

TIPS:
To reduce the degree to which keytest writes to your HDD, you may want to run 
   mount -t tmpfs -o size=50m tmpfs /home/keytest/kt.dir
as root
