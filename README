--- LyXtest ---

This is a program to spam LyX with millions of randomly generated key
presses, and collect the crash results.

Since the code involves spamming random keypresses, I'd recommend
running it in a VM, well away from your main X windows session.

In short, to use this, run development/keytest/lyx_make.sh

It requires the following packages to run
  xvkbd wmctrl
the following are also useful:
   lyx libqt4-dbg subversion automake

It is run by running ./autolyx in one xterm, and ./test.py in another.
I wrote lyx_make.sh as a easy way of updating lyx and running these two
programs together.

CONTENTS:

README: this readme file
report.sh: A quick way of generating bug reports and an overview from the logs.
autolyx: A script to continually restart lyx and collect the bug reports
lyx_make.sh: should updates, compiles, and everything needed to generated logs.
maketar.sh: Makes this tar file :)
test.py: Sends LT100 randomly generated keypresses per second to the LyX window.
killtest: stop the testing
stock_text: The stock test to add to each bug report.

OUTPUTS:

autolyx: Outputs out/GDB, a log of all output, including backtraces.
test.py: Outputs out/KEYCODES, a list of all keycodes sent to LyX

reports.sh: Outputs
  out/overview: an overview of all the frequency of each error
  out/overview_sort: as above but sorted
  out/report_*: A collection of autogenerated bug reports.
