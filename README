--- LyXtest ---

This is a program to spam LyX with millions of randomly generated key
presses, and collect the crash results.

Since the code involves spamming random keypresses, I run it under a special
user "keytest", well away from my main X windows session.

To use this software, first configure it by editing the 
configuration parameters in shared_functions.sh and shared_variables.sh
then run the following:

./setup.sh   # add keytest user and apt-get required files
sudo -H -u keytest -e xterm # Create a xterm for running keytest in
. ./initXvfb # sets up a fake X server for keytest to play in
./main.sh

Note that this bug finding software is itself quite buggy.

CONTENTS:

README: this readme file
report_html.sh: A quick way of generating bug reports and an overview from the logs.
make_screen_shots.sh: a script for making screenshots, if they are missing from output of above.
autolyx: A script to continually restart lyx and collect the bug reports
maketar.sh: Makes this tar file :)
keytest.py: Sends randomly generated keypresses to the LyX window.
killtest: stop the testing
stock_text: The stock test to add to each bug report.
watch_keytest.sh: Dumps various info on what keytest is doing, often run as "watch watch_keytest.sh"
	Watching the output of this is almost as much fun as playing "ProgressQuest"	
cache-bisect.sh: A script for determining when a regression occurs. 
        It uses large amount of disk space to cache previously compiled versions of LyX to speed up the bisect.


OUTPUTS:

autolyx: Outputs out/*.GDB, a log of all output, including backtraces.
keytest.py: Outputs out/*.KEYCODES, a list of all keycodes sent to LyX

BISECTING:
cache-bisect.sh is roughly equivalent to "git bisect run" but takes care of
building LyX and of keeping cached pre-compiled versions of LyX around. 

Cache-bisect.sh can take as input a .sh file or a .KEYCODEpure file.
It can convert file URIs into filenames, so you can paste the "pure" link
generated from ./report_html.sh into a terminal. This means the standard way
to run cache-bisect.sh is something like:
  cache-bisect.sh file:///mnt/big/keytest/html_out/out/t6/html/1275784335.html

The .sh file is similar to a script used by git bisect, but it can assume that
there is a precompiled LyX binary at 
    EXE=`pwd`_bin/bin/lyx

When cache-bisect.sh is running you can see how much progress it has made by
running
  tail -f /tmp/cache-bisect.*.log

For example, if you run 
  ./cache-bisect.sh examples/CopyColumn.KEYCODEpure
then after a few hours the line:
  Relevant Versions ['33494', '33495']
should appear in a file 
  /tmp/cache-bisect.*.log
The first "Relevant Version" is the one we know is good and the last is the
one we know is bad, so here the regression is in r33495. If there are 
more than two Relevant Versions then the ones in the middle are ones that
could have introduced the regression, but we don't know (usually because
we could not build the Versions in question).

If you want to test the ability to use a script in place of a KEYCODEpure
file, try running
  ./cache-bisect.sh examples/AssertOnMerge.sh
In this case it should report r32772 as the regression

Sometimes a problem doesn't occur 100% of the
time, perhaps just because LyX loses some keypresses and the script isn't
clever enought to send them again. In any case we may want to reproduce the
problem a number of times before we mark a particular version as being "Good".
To do this, replace the 0001 in cache-bisect.sh with the desired number of times.

If a bisect is interrupted, you may want to manually set the GOOD/BAD versions.

You can do this with something like:
   (VERS="32548 32538" ./cache-bisect.sh file:///mnt/big/keytest/html_out/out/t6/html/1276005507.KEYCODEpure)
Note that the higher version comes first.

TIPS:

keytest can generate a lot of IO, that can make the forground task slow, even though keytest is running at nice level 19. Using noatime, ext4 instead of ext3, compcache/ramzswap and rebooting regularly may (or may not) help.


cache-bisect.sh can be useful to find which exact regression caused a bug. However it can be quite difficult to compile old LyX svn trunk versions.

E.g to compile r27418 on ubuntu 9.10, I needed to do the following
 ln /usr/lib/libboost_filesystem{-mt,}.so
 ln /usr/lib/libboost_regex{-mt,}.so
 ln /usr/lib/libboost_signals{-mt,}.so
 ln /usr/lib/libboost_iostreams{-mt,}.so

nd needed to apply the patch r27418.patch, to compile with gcc-4.4 but it is probably better to just compile the old versions with gcc-4.2

You are likely to have to install automake1.10. Also you will have to install the old autoconf 2.63. I found installing the autoconf2.63 from Jaunty onto Karmic helped. I then added the following three lines to /etc/apt/preferences so ti wouldn't keep trying to upgrade autoconf to 2.64:

Package: autoconf
Pin: version 2.63*
Pin-Priority:  1001



I have set cache-bisect to use gcc 4.2 as older versions of boost have trouble with gcc 4.4

To complile versions earlier than about r27000, you will need even older versions. I installed autoconf 2.60 in /usr/local/bin and added the following symlinks to my path.
aclocal -> /usr/bin/aclocal-1.9
autoconf -> /usr/local/bin/autoconf
autoheader -> /usr/local/bin/autoheader
autom4te -> /usr/local/bin/autom4te
automake -> /usr/bin/automake-1.9
autoreconf -> /usr/local/bin/autoreconf
autoscan -> /usr/local/bin/autoscan
autoupdate -> /usr/local/bin/autoupdate
cc1obj -> /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.4/cc1obj
ifnames -> /home/xp/src/autoconf-2.60/bin/ifnames
Makefile -> /home/xp/src/autoconf-2.60/bin/Makefile

ERRORS:
Q: Why do I get errors like the following?
config/dbus] couldn't take over org.x.config: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied (Connection ":1.153" is not allowed to own the service "org.x.config.display5" due to security policies in the configuration file)
(EE) config/hal: NewInputDeviceRequest failed (2)
(EE) config/hal: NewInputDeviceRequest failed (2)
(EE) config/hal: NewInputDeviceRequest failed (2)
(EE) config/hal: NewInputDeviceRequest failed (2)
(EE) config/hal: NewInputDeviceRequest failed (2)

A: because you haven't listed the X-server in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/xorg-server.conf
