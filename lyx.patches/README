this directory is full of patches that need to be applied to particular versions of LyX to get them to compile
each patch is of the format:
XXXXX--YYYYY.diff

where XXXXX is the first version that requires this patch and YYYYY is the last.

Generally the patch is generated by running 
   svn diff -c YYYYY+1
